## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
What the the relational operators and how to use them
What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
What are the boolean operators and how to use them
How to use the if, if ... else statements
How to use comments
How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
How to assign values to variables
How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
How to use the while loop
How to use variables with the while loop
How to print variables using printf
What is the ASCII character set
What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64

## Requirements

General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
You are not allowed to use system
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

## Task 

Task 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing: This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative. ou can find the source code (https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c)

Task 1. The last digit: This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. You can find the source code here (https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c)

Task 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game: Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Task 3. alphABET: Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

Task 4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off: Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Task 5. Numbers: Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

Task 6. Numberz: Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

Task 7. Smile in the mirror: Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

8. Hexadecimal: Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Task 9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success: Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

Task 10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need: Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

Task 11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...: Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

12. Software is eating the World: Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
